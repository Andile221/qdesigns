<p>Khulanathi Projects started off as only a painting business back in the early 2000s. The business was
founded by Mr Michael Qwabe, the man who worked for the painting company called A1 for approximately 
27 years. After being retrenched from A1, Michael Qwabe started off his own painting business called Khulanathi 
Projects. It was more of a family business because he was working with his children. As the years went by, the 
business was not making much money, so certain decisions had to be made. In 2013, Michael invented a new design 
in the business called Facebrick Design. Michael introduced the design to his children who were part of the business
and they learned it very fast. The business started doing the design in most homes and more people seem to love 
it. Since from 2014, Khulanathi Projects became more focused in Facebrick Design other than Painting. The business 
has been growing since then up until now.</p>
